        <p class="info-cards-paragraphs">
          Superman, Clark Kent, is obviously a favorite of many many people today. A lot of folks like the allure of his god-like powers, his raw strength.
          However, many many people also hate him for this, they dislike him for being overpowered. I agree, he is VERY VERY powerful. This man can fly
          to the moon and back in mere minutes, seconds even. He could level cities in the blink of an eye. He could crumble empires on a whim, 
          with very few people capable of even slowing him down. But every day, he wakes up and chooses not to do ANY of this. He doesn't even think of these things.
          Everyday, Clark Kent (or Kal-el, whatever you fancy) chooses to be a symbol of reason, hope, unity, and Love. Very few of his fellow heroes
          could even begin to match his will, and his faith in humanity. And quite frankly, fewer people in the real world could. I know I'd definitely have
          done some terrible things if I were given his abilities. But not the big bule. I mean this man has ALWAYS had infinite powers, even AS A KID. And
          he ALWAYS used them for good, never once deflecting to the dark side, even in situations where many would agree that he should. The ends never "justify the means" 
          if it meant doing horrible things. His morality is truly the greatest of all his powers, and everyday I aspire to be like him in this way. <br> My 
          favorite supermen are: Superman from the DC animated movie "Superman vs The Elites"(2012), Superman from the DC Rebirth Comics(2016-2018), and Superman from "Kingdom Come" by Mark Waid

        <p class="info-cards-paragraphs" >
          Matt Murdock, the man without fear, Hornhead. He is a man of many names, but my personal favorite is: "The DEVIL OF HELL'S KITCHEN". I will admit,
          my love for the devil of hell's kitchen started out because he reminded me of superman. He was one of the few heroes I was PUSHED to the edge, further than 
          it would take most to crack, but Matt held on to his values, to his morality. This is especially note worthy to me because, while it is really impressive
          for a being to be as powerful as superman and still hold on to pure values and morality, superman is a god--there are only a handful of people that can stand
          up to him. This makes it easier for him to not kill people, because quite frankly speaking, he almost never HAS to go that far to neutralize most threats. He
          never has to fear for his life, and almost never has to be in a kill or be killed situation. Daredevil, however, is NOT a god. He's a mortal man with no enhanced 
          strength or invulnerability. His only powers are his enhanced senses, which come in quite useful, but hardly make him invincible. Despite the many situations where
          the only way he can ensure his safety is to kill or do something absolutely terrible to a person, the devil holds on tenaciously to his code. The man--or devil, if 
          I may--had the life of his father's murderer in HIS HANDS, but he still held on to his code. He chose justice over vengance. With that in mind, I think he just has one
          of those ironic nicknames, 'cause sparing the life of your parent's killer definitely makes you an angel in my book. <br> 
          My favorite Daredevil is the one portrayed by Charlie Cox on Netflix's Daredevil(2015-2018)

        <p class="info-cards-paragraphs" id="miles">
           Miles Morales, what to even say about this guy!! Whenever I rant about my boy miles, I always start out by saying: getting the opportunity 
           to see Miles Morales grow up is easily top five best things to happen to me. I have learned so much from this character, even from the 
           unfortunately short period of time I have known him. I first took a deep dive into Miles' story during the hit movie Into the SpiderVerse(2018),
           and I FELL IN LOVE. The story's themes of faith, grief, and isolation really hit close to home. At the time I watched Spiderverse, I was going 
           through a rather scary period of my life. It was my last year of high-school, and I had two ways my world could go, Option One: Somehow miraculously
           get as much scholarships as possible to sponsor me through out college, Option two: Work at walmart straight outta high school for God knows how long. This is a bit of 
           an oversimplification of the things that were keeping me up at night during that time of my life, but how I would possibly be able to afford college was 
           definitely up there on the list (top five worst). Miles on the other hand, was faced with the need to replace a dead Peter Parker as Spider-Man mere weeks 
           after Miles got his powers, and save the entirety of Brooklyn as well as a number of his friends. (I think it's safe to say that he had bigger problems) It 
           was no question that Miles was TERRIFIED, this was an impossible task. But in the end, he did it. He did it, by finding the courage to truly believe in himself
           in a way I hadn't seen any hero do. He took a leap of faith (literally), and he helped me believe in myself and take my leaps of faith too. <br>
           Needless to say, my favorite Miles Morales is the one from the Into the Spiderverse movie (2018), followed by Miles Morales from Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020)
